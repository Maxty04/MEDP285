						<p>When you hear <a href="https://www.tiffany.com" target= "_blank">Tiffany and Co</a>, what does the name make you think of?<p>
							<p>Engagement rings, fancy jewelry and Tiffany Blue.
							One of the world’s most iconic jewelry brand, Tiffany and Co is associated and identified by a single colour, colloquially called Tiffany blue. Today the colour Tiffany blue is protected in almost all countries and anyone can get sued for attempting to use the colour.<p>
							A colour trademark is a non-conventional trademark where at least one colour is used to perform the trademark function of uniquely identifying the commercial origin of products or services. It was in 1845, when Jeweller, Charles Lewis Tiffany, chose the light medium tone of Robin Egg blue for the packaging of the brand’s jewelry. Today, the brand’s visual identity is based on this shade of blue. The shade is Tiffany blue 1837 as per the Pantone chart and is not available commercially as the colour has been successfully trademarked since 1998 when they filed for the trademark with the federal government.<p>
							In the case of Qualitex, the Supreme court, and in his opinion that favored Qualitex, who ultimately won the case, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote: “Color alone, at least sometimes, can meet the basic legal requirements for use as a trademark. It can act as a symbol that distinguishes a firm’s goods and identifies their source, without serving any other significant function.”<p>
							The thing that needs to be understood is that Tiffany & Co only owns the colour in certain cases, when it can be confused with its brand usage. Tiffany only owns “robin’s egg blue” for its boxes and bags.</p>
